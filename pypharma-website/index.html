					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-sm-4">
							<h3>Purpose</h3>
							<p>PyPharma will be a meeting, exchange and learning point for industry and academic scientific python users in pharma. At PyPharma, we will learn about the most interesting current challenges in the field and the new and exciting python tools and packages that can be used to tackle them.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-sm-4">
							<h3>Scope</h3>
							<p>PyPharma will be aimed at pharmaceutical python users of all levels working in data science, and it will welcome talks, posters and workshops covering all aspects of the pharmaceutical lifecycle and ecosystem where python tools are applied as well as data modalities.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-sm-4">
							<h3>Concept</h3>
							<p>PyPharma is fully run by volunteers in the pharmaceutical industry and academia. Attendance will be based on invites, and it will be a single track, 2-day conference. Attendance will be purposely kept small to maximize interaction between the audience and the speakers.</p>
