					<div id="keynote_1" class="collapse pypharma-bio">
					    <p>María Rodríguez Martínez did her undergraduate studies in Physical Sciences at Universidad Complutense de Madrid. She then did her PhD in Theoretical Cosmology, at the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris. Her PhD research focused on developing cosmological models of the early evolution of the universe with additional spatial dimensions. After completing her PhD, she moved to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where she focused on setting astrophysical bounds to theories that break Lorentz symmetry using the high-energy emissions from Gamma-Ray Bursts, extremely powerful explosions of gamma rays coming from outside our galaxy.

In 2007, she transitioned into the field of Systems Biology as a postdoc at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot (Israel). Her research was devoted to the development of quantitative descriptions of biological networks and the complex interactions within. In 2009, she moved to Columbia University where she developed quantitative models to understand cancer gene dysregulation.

María joined IBM as a Research Staff Member in November 2013. Her research at IBM focuses on integrating different high-throughput molecular datasets in order to build comprehensive molecular models of disease that can help clinicians to provide better diagnoses and suggest personalized therapies.</p>

					    <p>After obtaining a degree in bioinformatics from the computer science faculty at the University of Tübingen in 2009, Kai switched to Institute for Microbiology and Infection Medicine at the same university to obtain his PhD. During his PhD project, he co-developed the antiSMASH genome mining tool, initially released in 2010. Building on his software engineering knowledge obtained working on Open Source software projects since his undergrad days, Kai has focused on developing translational bioinformatics tools and databases. During his first post-doc at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing in Cologne, Germany, he worked on the doRiNA database of RNA interactions in post-transcriptional regulation. Returning to natural products research, Kai joined the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability (NNFCFB) at the Technical University of Denmark, in Lyngby, Denmark. In addition to returning to antiSMASH development, he has driven the development of the antiSMASH database, the CRISPR/Cas sgRNA design tool CRISPy-web, and a number of smaller software projects. Kai is currently working as a Researcher at the NNFCFB, where he heads the bioinformatics group of the New Bioactive Compounds section ran by Sang Yup Lee and Tilmann Weber.</p>

					    <p>After getting a Ph.D. in Theoretical Chemistry in the group of Roald Hoffmann at Cornell University and doing a post-doctoral fellowship in Aachen Germany Greg moved to California where he worked at a couple of startups and started applying machine learning to life-sciences problems. In 2006 he moved to Basel to work at the Novartis Insitutes for BioMedical Research. Greg spent about five years in the computer aided drug design group and then shifted to research IT to head the group responsible for chemistry software and data systems. Eventually he was also responsible for an internal initiative to integrate internal and external biological and chemical data and make it available to researchers. He now splits his time between KNIME and T5 Informatics, a consulting company providing support and services related to the open-source cheminformatics toolkit RDKit. Greg has been using Python together with C++ to solve scientific problems for 20 years now.</p>
