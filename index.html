To create value from data you need solutions for all steps of the process: Data acquisition, cleaning, structuring, annotation, integration, modeling, validation and much more. Even when all technological challenges are addressed, you have to account for the most important aspect of data applications: The human beings who decide what to do and how to use the technology. There are two key aspects of data applications that are overlooked by the current AI hype. First, integrating heterogenous data is still an issue. Second, getting an overview of data is essential to take informed decisions. Knowledge graphs have the potential to adress these aspects and to serve as the central hub of your data application. They link heterogenous data sources and provide access to structured data for decision making, data analysis and end-user applications. In my talk I will give examples how biomedical knowledge graphs implemented in the graph database Neo4j help to link molecular and patient level data. On top of that, I discuss how knowledge graphs can support the use of real world evidence for early stage drug development.</td></tr>

Both targets and ligands are dynamic, exploring multiple conformations. Thus, the typical methods that assume a single binding pose or a single shape for a pocket will have limited ability to predict realistic interactions. As pharmaceutical industry moves to larger drugs such as cyclic peptides or therapeutic proteins, molecular flexibility is starting to be more and more important. For example, cell permeability of cyclic peptides can be modulated by their conformational changes.</p> <p>In order for molecular dynamics to be fully adopted by the industry, better tools are needed to manage computational workflows and explore the resulting data. Here, I will discuss a Python middleware that simplifies the running and analysis of molecular dynamics simulations and allows the user to interactively analyse the resulting multidimensional data. I will also present the use of this tool in the context of a research challenge of predicting the permeability of cyclic peptides.</p></td></tr>

As anincreasing number of microorganisms is becoming resistant against the antimicrobial compoundscurrently in use, there is a dire need for new compounds and compound classes that show newmodes of action to avoid the current resistance mechanisms. In the last decade, the increasingavailability of microbial genomes has established genome mining as a very important method for theidentification of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for producing such novel compounds.This talk will present antiSMASH, a Python-based tool to mine microbial genomes for interestingBGCs in order to find new bioactive lead compounds. I will show how Python helped antiSMASH tobecome the most widely used tool in the field, with over half a million of processed jobs and over 2000weekly users on the public web service alone.

In computational biology, the recent availability of large amounts of data generated by large international consortia together with technical developments facilitating the implementation and training of more performant models have made possible the broad application of deep learning and machine learning approaches to a vast set of problems.</p>
                        
                        <p>In this talk, I will present current activities at the Computational Systems Biology group in IBM Research, Zurich, that illustrate the application of AI approaches to unravel disease mechanisms and develop personalized patient models. For instance, I will show how models for text ingestion can be used to automatically extract knowledge from biomedical publications and obtain comprehensive maps of molecular interactions. I will also show how multi-modal neural networks can be trained to ingest disparate data types, such as compound molecular structures, transcriptomic data and prior molecular knowledge, to predict drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines.

With the help of supervised and unsupervised methods tasks like computer vision, recognition of speech or text have been revolutionized. Due to this high impact of ML ongoing research focuses on the constant improvement of these methods. However, ML is not exclusively the subject of research, but can also be used as a tool for the investigation of research questions. For example, ML is used to uncover hidden patterns in experimental data not detectable with neither the human eye nor standard statistical methods or to train machines so that they can take over repetitive tasks like object recognition. In this talk I will present current applications of ML in research from different domain sciences. I will focus on Python-based techniques for data preparation and analysis applying both standard ML methods and state-of-the-art implementations of deep neural networks.</td></tr>

Within this context, machine learning methods, experimental design and de-novo structure generation have all found a place to facilitate and accelerate lead optimisation. However, they have tended to be used in a reactive manner, to address problems posed by program teams rather than as a continual and proactive process. In this presentation we will describe how data-driven cheminformatics-based AI methods have the potential to automate parts of the lead optimisation process which historically has been a very time-consuming task. This strategy adds the ability to explore and exploit multiple paths within chemical space and suggest structural modifications that will gain better understanding of the SAR problem at hand. In addition, by continually improving computational models we can extrapolate to new regions of chemical space and suggest novel compounds. The implications of automation for the human-machine interface will be explored and illustrated with examples from BRADSHAW, GSK's experimental automated design environment.</td></tr>

These opportunities also pose some challenges:  (i) there are currently no widely-accepted analytical tools and (ii) there are few standardized assays available to assess the functionality of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. With the advent of high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs), researchers have the ability to probe the cellular and network phenotypes of commercially available iPSC-lines. In this talk we will showcase a comparison between midbrain dopaminergic neurons from a healthy subject (WT), and an isogenic cell line carrying the A53T alpha-synuclein mutation associated with early-onset familiar Parkinson's disease (PD). We developed a pipeline in Python to reliably infer features that allow characterizing iPSC neuronal networks at the single-cell and network level, and investigated the development of these features. Machine learning models were applied to infer which features were most informative to predict the phenotype. The talk will cover these models in detail and will provide pointers to the Python resources used to conduct the analyses.</strike></td></tr>

With single volumes now reaching the scale of petabytes, manual approaches are no longer viable and automation becomes a necessity. Within the Connectomics team at Google (https://ai.google/research/teams/perception/connectomics/) we have developed infrastructure and algorithms for storage, analysis, and visualization of such large volumetric datasets. Much of this software stack is open source and implemented in Python. In the talk, I will describe how we use this reconstruction pipeline to convert series of EM images into brain connectivity diagrams, and how modern machine learning techniques based on deep neural networks allow us to solve classification and segmentation problems in such datasets.</td></tr>

					    <p>María Rodríguez Martínez did her undergraduate studies in Physical Sciences at Universidad Complutense de Madrid. She then did her PhD in Theoretical Cosmology, at the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris. Her PhD research focused on developing cosmological models of the early evolution of the universe with additional spatial dimensions. After completing her PhD, she moved to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where she focused on setting astrophysical bounds to theories that break Lorentz symmetry using the high-energy emissions from Gamma-Ray Bursts, extremely powerful explosions of gamma rays coming from outside our galaxy.

In 2007, she transitioned into the field of Systems Biology as a postdoc at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot (Israel). Her research was devoted to the development of quantitative descriptions of biological networks and the complex interactions within. In 2009, she moved to Columbia University where she developed quantitative models to understand cancer gene dysregulation.

María joined IBM as a Research Staff Member in November 2013. Her research at IBM focuses on integrating different high-throughput molecular datasets in order to build comprehensive molecular models of disease that can help clinicians to provide better diagnoses and suggest personalized therapies.</p>
